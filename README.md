Algorithm: -
Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Read the elements in sorted order “list” and “n” be the number of elements in the list.
Step 3: Read the new elements to be inserted.
Step 4: set position=0
Step 5: For each element in the list, repeat the following.
Step 5.1: check if new element<list[i], then go to steps 5.1.1
else increment position = position +1 and go to step 5.
Step 5.1.1: move the cards from current position to next position.
Step 5.1.2: insert the new element in the current position and go to step 6.
Step 6: print the sorted list
step 7: Stop.
